# COSC 3320: Graph Algorithms
Ly Ha and Danny Le

In this assignment, we have chosen to do SSSP and MST.

graph: graph.cpp
  g++ graph.cpp -o graph
  
in order to run the program
  ./graph inPutFileName outPutFileName alg
  
We have attempted the extra credit bonus by reading the input graph block by block.
